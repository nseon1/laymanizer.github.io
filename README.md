Laymanizer
==========

Laymanizer is an openai and streamlit powered webapp that simplifies confusing text by replacing complicated words with less technical jargon and layman terms.

Features
--------

-   Simplifies text by replacing complex words with layman terms
-   Uses OpenAI's language model to ensure accurate and easy-to-understand simplifications
-   Powered by Streamlit, a powerful and user-friendly web framework for building data-driven apps

How it Works
------------

Laymanizer uses natural language processing (NLP) to analyze the input text and identify complex words and phrases. It then replaces these with simpler, more understandable alternatives, ensuring that the overall meaning of the text is preserved.

Users can simply input the text they want to simplify, and Laymanizer takes care of the rest. The simplified text is displayed on the webapp, making it easy to copy and paste or share with others.

Technologies Used
-----------------

Laymanizer is built using the following technologies:

-   Python programming language
-   OpenAI's GPT-3 language model
-   Streamlit web framework

How to Use
----------

To use Laymanizer, simply go to the webapp's URL and enter the text you want to simplify. The app will automatically process the text and display the simplified version. Users can copy and paste the simplified text, or share it directly from the webapp.

Future Plans
------------

In the future, we plan to add more features to Laymanizer, such as the ability to customize the level of simplification and to provide explanations of complex terms. We also plan to explore other NLP models and techniques to improve the accuracy and effectiveness of the app and make it into a browser extension for easy use.

Thank you for considering Laymanizer we sincerely hope you find it helpful!
